Raspberry Pi project: LED morse code SOS signal when a button is pressed
Each time the button is pressed, the SOS signal in morse code is repeated 3 times using the LED.
You must connect the LED to GPIO pin 23, then routed to ground (GND)
You must connect the button to GPIO pin 24, then routed to ground (GND)
IMPORTANT: You must use the correct resistor and LED specifications
